## **📌 Introduction**  
This project focuses on machine learning with a **Zero Trust Learning** approach. The Zero Trust concept, commonly used in cybersecurity, is applied here to **protect deep learning models against adversarial attacks**.  

## **🔍 What is Zero Trust Learning?**  
Zero Trust Learning is a security framework for machine learning that assumes no data, model, or process is trustworthy unless proven otherwise. This method ensures security at multiple levels, including **data input, model optimization, and output control**.  

## **🚀 Key Features**  
✅ Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for data processing  
✅ Implements Zero Trust security mechanisms to prevent adversarial attacks  
✅ Analyzes the impact of adversarial attacks on deep learning models  
✅ Evaluates model performance under different conditions
